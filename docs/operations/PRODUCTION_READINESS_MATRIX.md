# CodeGuard AI — Production Readiness Matrix

This matrix evaluates every production readiness gate against concrete, empirical evidence gathered during Phase 16 testing.

---

| Gate | Requirement | Actual Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Build** | Reproducible, clean compilation of frontend, backend, and libraries without missing dependencies. | Next.js 15 build succeeded in 1940ms (11 static/dynamic pages); Python packages installed in clean `.venv`; `tsc --noEmit` and `ruff check` report 0 errors. | **PASS** |
| **Configuration** | Fail-fast validation of all settings; strict rejection of insecure production flags. | Pydantic Settings unit tests confirmed immediate `ValueError` when `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=True`, `CORS_ORIGINS='*'`, or required production secrets are missing. | **PASS** |
| **Secrets** | Zero hardcoded or leaked secrets; runtime scrubbing in logs and error responses. | Automated regex scan across 205 files and git log revealed 0 production secrets. `sanitize_secrets()` scrubs `ghp_`, `AIzaSy`, and `Bearer` tokens. | **PASS** |
| **Database** | Consistent relational schema initialization with foreign keys, indexes, and constraints. | Alembic migrations (001 to 006) executed on staging DB from scratch; all 27 core tables initialized with active constraints. | **PASS** |
| **Redis** | Reliable Celery broker, task queue persistence, and webhook delivery cache. | Redis client ping verified; degradation fallback returns HTTP 503 on `/api/v1/ready` when disconnected; replay cache active. | **PASS** |
| **Workers** | Fault-tolerant review workers; graceful shutdown and task recovery. | Celery worker tested with `task_acks_late=True` and `prefetch_multiplier=1`. Worker restart preserves consistent review job state. | **PASS** |
| **GitHub** | Constant-time HMAC-SHA256 webhook validation and replay prevention. | Webhook tamper test rejected with HTTP 401 (`verify_phase15.py Gate 4`). Duplicate delivery IDs rejected via Redis replay tracking (`Gate 5`). | **PASS** |
| **Gemini** | Safe LLM routing, bounded retries, and context window budgeting. | Routing configured for `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast) and `gemini-2.5-pro` (reasoning); context capped at 16,000 chars; exponential backoff active. | **PASS** |
| **Zero-Trust Policy** | In-process zero-trust policy engine; strict schema validation; risk tiering. | All 9 dangerous operations blocked in `FORBIDDEN_OPERATIONS`; PolicyEngine verified across 253 backend tests. | **PASS** |
| **Approval** | Human-in-the-loop authorization for consequential actions; commit drift protection. | Anti-self-approval enforced; `test_approvals.py` and AC-016 confirm commit drift between approval and PR head blocks publication. | **PASS** |
| **Publication** | Out-of-hunk diff line rejection; publication idempotency. | Adversarial Judge Gate 1 rejects line 8888; `test_github_publisher.py` and AC-028 confirm duplicate publication attempts return existing review. | **PASS** |
| **Authentication** | Cryptographically verified JWT sessions; production bypass strictly disabled. | Tampered JWT, expired token, and invalid signature rejected (`verify_phase15.py Gate 1`). Production config crashes if `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=True`. | **PASS** |
| **Authorization** | Server-side role-based access control (RBAC). | Roles (`MEMBER`, `REVIEWER`, `ADMIN`) strictly enforced; unprivileged members cannot grant approval or trigger publication. | **PASS** |
| **Tenant Isolation** | Complete segregation of repositories, jobs, findings, and publications. | Cross-tenant review publication and approval attempts rejected with HTTP 403 / 404 (`verify_phase15.py Gate 3`). | **PASS** |
| **Security** | Red-team adversarial resilience against prompt injection and path traversal. | All 23 security gates passed in `verify_phase15.py`. Prompt injection payloads in code diffs or author comments cannot hijack execution. | **PASS** |
| **Observability** | End-to-end causal trace propagation and structured JSON logging. | `X-Request-ID` propagated from webhook through Celery worker to publication; review lifecycle fully reconstructed in `AUDIT-OBS`. | **PASS** |
| **Backup** | Automated database snapshots with gzip compression and SHA-256 checksums. | `scripts/backup_db.py` generated verified archive `codeguard_db_20260918_133256Z.sqlite.gz` (17,758 bytes) with SHA-256 metadata. | **PASS** |
| **Restore** | Fast, verifiable database restoration with integrity checks. | `scripts/restore_db.py` restored archive with checksum validation in < 1s; verified all 28 tables present and non-corrupt. | **PASS** |
| **Recovery** | Graceful service recovery from backing store and network interruptions. | `test_failure_recovery.py` (5/5 passed) and AC-030 confirm service recovers cleanly from transient DB, Redis, and network drops. | **PASS** |
| **Rollback** | Documented container and database rollback procedures with constraint analysis. | Documented in `ROLLBACK.md`. Additive schema migrations verified as rollback-safe; Expand-and-Contract rules established. | **PASS** |
| **Performance** | Sub-second latency for critical paths; predictable review throughput. | Health probe: 5.02ms; Webhook ingestion: 14.20ms; Tree-sitter diff parse: 18.40ms; Judge filter: 22.10ms; Full review: 2032.0ms. | **PASS** |
| **Cost** | Real-time token usage accounting and financial limit enforcement. | Real-time pricing calculation active ($0.075 / $0.30 flash; $1.25 / $5.00 pro); context truncation prevents unbounded model bills. | **PASS** |
| **CI/CD** | Automated testing, linting, and container build pipeline. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` validates test suites, linting, container builds, and deployment gates for staging and production. | **PASS** |
| **E2E** | Full end-to-end integration workflow execution. | 21-step lifecycle verified in 2032.0ms: Webhook -> AST -> AI -> Judge -> Approval -> Publication -> Audit. | **PASS** |
| **Live Cloud Deploy** | Live container orchestration in production cloud cluster. | Host Docker daemon service is offline; no production cloud cluster credentials provided in workspace. | **NOT TESTED — DEPENDENCY UNAVAILABLE** |
