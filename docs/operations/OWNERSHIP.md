## 1. Ownership Principles

1. **Role-Based Accountability**: Responsibilities are assigned to functional engineering roles rather than individual employee names to ensure continuous institutional maintainability.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Access to production infrastructure, cryptographic signing keys, and cloud billing accounts is strictly compartmentalized.
3. **Owner Authorization Gates**: Consequential actions (e.g. production deployments, credential rotations, database rollbacks, legal pilot authorizations) strictly require formal Project Owner sign-off.

## 4. Escalation & Incident Triage Protocol

In the event of an operational degradation, security alert, or production outage:

1. **Severity 1 (Critical Outage / False Authorization / Data Breach)**:
   - *Escalation Time*: Immediate (< 15 minutes).
   - *Notified Roles*: Project Owner, Security Lead, DevOps / SRE Lead, Backend Lead.
   - *Action*: Execute emergency review publication kill-switch ([`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](file:///c:/Users/sugud/OneDrive/Documents/codeguard-ai/docs/RUNBOOK.md) Section 4.4).
2. **Severity 2 (Degraded Performance / Celery Queue Backlog / 429 Quota Alert)**:
   - *Escalation Time*: Within 1 hour.
   - *Notified Roles*: Backend Lead, DevOps / SRE Lead.
   - *Action*: Scale worker replicas or adjust rate limit backoff.
3. **Severity 3 (Minor UI Glitch / Non-Blocking Test Warning)**:
   - *Escalation Time*: Standard business hours.
   - *Notified Roles*: Primary Subsystem Owner.
   - *Action*: Triage during weekly sprint planning.
