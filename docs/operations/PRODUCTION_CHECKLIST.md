## 4. Rollback Verification Protocol

If any Post-Deployment verification item fails:
1. **Trigger Rollback**: SRE Lead issues rollback command:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps api worker web
   ```
2. **Database Verification**: If migration was additive, leave schema as-is; if non-additive, run `alembic downgrade -1`.
3. **Verify Restored Health**: Confirm prior version responds on `/api/v1/live` and `/api/v1/ready`.
4. **Post-Incident Declaration**: Initiate Incident Response protocol per `INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`.
