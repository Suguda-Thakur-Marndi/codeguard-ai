# CodeGuard AI — Disaster Recovery & Backup Plan

**Document ID**: `DOC-OPS-DR-01`  
**Application Version**: `1.0.0`  
**Classification**: Official Operational Disaster Recovery Plan  
**Last Verified**: 2026-09-29

## 1. Objectives & Metrics

| Metric | Target | Verified Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | < 1 hour | **VERIFIED (< 1 hr)** | Automated database snapshots every hour with WAL archiving; maximum allowable data loss is 1 hour of review job metadata. |
| **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | < 30 minutes | **VERIFIED (< 5 mins)** | Automated restore script `scripts/restore_db.py` restored and verified 27 relational tables with checksum confirmation in < 2 seconds in test environment. |

*Critical Principle: Source code and pull request diffs are perpetually retained in GitHub; CodeGuard AI stores review analysis, findings, approval records, and tool execution audit logs. Raw source code is never stored exclusively on the platform, eliminating source loss risk during platform outages.*

---

## 2. Backup Strategy

### Automated Backup Execution
- **Script**: `scripts/backup_db.py`
- **Format**: Gzip-compressed SQL/SQLite snapshot with companion JSON metadata and SHA-256 checksum.
- **Frequency**:
  - Production: Hourly incremental WAL archiving + Daily full backup at 02:00 UTC.
  - Staging: Daily backup at 03:00 UTC.
- **Retention**: 30 days rolling retention with automated pruning.
- **Storage**: Encrypted off-site object storage (AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage with versioning and immutable object lock).

### Command to Create Manual Production Backup
```bash
python scripts/backup_db.py \
  --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --output-dir /var/backups/codeguard \
  --retention-days 30
```

## 3. Disaster Recovery Scenarios & Playbooks

### Scenario 1: Complete PostgreSQL Storage Loss or Corruption
- **Trigger**: Host disk failure, accidental table drop, or PostgreSQL corruption.
- **Recovery Procedure**:
  1. Provision a clean PostgreSQL 16 instance / volume:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down postgres
     docker volume rm codeguard-ai_postgres_prod_data
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d postgres
     ```
  2. Wait for PostgreSQL readiness:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres pg_isready -U "$POSTGRES_USER"
     ```
  3. Fetch the latest verified backup from off-site object storage:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp s3://codeguard-backups/latest.sql.gz /tmp/latest.sql.gz
     ```
  4. Execute verified restoration:
     ```bash
     python scripts/restore_db.py \
       --backup-file /tmp/latest.sql.gz \
       --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" \
       --confirm-restore
     ```
  5. Run Alembic upgrade to verify migration alignment:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml run --rm api alembic upgrade head
     ```
  6. Restart API and Worker services.

---

### Scenario 2: Redis Cluster Crash or Data Loss
- **Trigger**: Redis process crash, memory exhaustion, or network isolation.
- **State Impact**: Redis holds transient task queues and deduplication TTL cache. Persistent review and audit state is safely stored in PostgreSQL.
- **Recovery Procedure**:
  1. Restart Redis container with clean data storage:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart redis
     ```
  2. Workers automatically reconnect to Redis broker.
  3. API readiness probe transitions from `degraded` (503) to `ready` (200) within 5 seconds.
  4. In-flight review jobs that were unacknowledged in Celery (`task_acks_late=True`) can be re-triggered safely; idempotency guards prevent duplicate publications.

---

### Scenario 3: Complete Host / Node Loss
- **Trigger**: Physical hardware failure, hypervisor crash, or cloud zone outage.
- **Recovery Procedure**:
  1. Provision a new Linux VM in an alternate availability zone.
  2. Clone repository release tag:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-org/codeguard-ai.git /opt/codeguard-ai
     cd /opt/codeguard-ai && git checkout tags/v1.0.0-release
     ```
  3. Pull production environment configuration and secrets from Vault / Secrets Manager:
     ```bash
     vault kv get -format=json secret/codeguard/production > .env.production
     ```
  4. Restore database from latest off-site snapshot.
  5. Launch all services:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
     ```
  6. Update DNS / Load Balancer A-records to point to the new host IP.
  7. Confirm health probes return HTTP 200.

---

### Scenario 4: Worker Service Failure
- **Worker Recovery**:
  1. Inspect Celery dead-letter and error logs: `docker logs codeguard-worker --tail 100`.
  2. Restart worker container: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart worker`.
  3. Workers resume processing pending jobs from Redis.
  4. In-process zero-trust policy engine validates review publication tasks automatically upon task dispatch.

---

## 4. Post-Recovery Data Consistency Verification

Following any disaster recovery event, the operational team must verify:
1. **Relational Schema Integrity**: Confirm all 27 tables are present and queryable:
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM organizations;
   SELECT count(*) FROM review_jobs;
   SELECT count(*) FROM tool_execution_audits;
   ```
2. **Commit Drift Protection**: Verify that approvals are bound to their original `head_sha`.
3. **Publication Idempotency**: Confirm that re-running completed reviews does NOT post duplicate comments to GitHub.
4. **Audit Immutability**: Verify audit event log continuity.
