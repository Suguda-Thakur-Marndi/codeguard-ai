# CodeGuard AI — Security Test Plan (Phase 15)

**Phase**: 15  
**Document**: Security Test Plan & Verification Procedures  
**Status**: Executable & Authoritative  

---

## 1. Scope & Test Objectives

The primary objective of this test plan is to empirically verify that CodeGuard AI resists realistic cyber attacks, malicious pull requests, privilege escalation, prompt injection, tool confusion, commit drift race conditions, path traversal, command injection, and data isolation failures.

All tests are executable via standard test runners without requiring external internet connectivity, mock LLMs in automated pipelines, and safe test fixtures without live credentials or destructive payloads.

---

## 2. Test Environment & Harness Architecture

- **Test Framework**: Pytest with `pytest-asyncio` in mode `AUTO`.
- **API Test Client**: Starlette `TestClient` invoking the live FastAPI app.
- **Database Fixture**: In-memory / Isolated SQLite or PostgreSQL test databases with schema migrations applied.
- **LLM Provider**: `MockLLMProvider` delivering deterministic responses with zero external API calls.
- **Primary Test Suites**:
  - `apps/api/tests/test_security_resilience.py` (11 resilience tests)
  - `apps/api/tests/test_security_audit_phase15.py` (38 audit & adversarial tests)
  - `verify_phase15.py` (Master 23-gate security certification script)
