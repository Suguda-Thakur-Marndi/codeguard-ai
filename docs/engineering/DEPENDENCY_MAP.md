## 1. Monorepo Dependency Overview

CodeGuard AI strictly segregates dependencies across specialized micro-packages and application services:
1. `apps/api`: Production backend, API endpoints, LangGraph orchestrator, database ORM, and Celery workers.
2. `packages/code-intelligence`: Core AST parsers, unified diff indexers, and dependency graph engines.
3. `apps/web`: Next.js 15 App Router web client.

## 4. Upgrade & Version Safety Policy

1. **Context7 Protocol**: Prior to any dependency upgrade, verify target library versions against installed locks and consult official release changelogs.
2. **Deterministic Version Pinning**:
   - Monorepo packages use lower-bound constraints (`>=X.Y.Z`) in library definitions and exact pins in runtime virtual environments (`.venv`).
   - Frontend locks are strictly committed in `package-lock.json` and deployed via `npm ci`.
3. **No Breaking Upgrades**: Upgrades that modify public APIs or break backwards-compatibility with existing stored database models are strictly rejected.
